<b>Abstract<b>

Computing has been revolutionizing the way people communicate, share and access information. Consequently, concerns about privacy and security are increasing. In this scenario, the literature reports that it is necessary to address privacy and security concerns from the Requirements Engineering (RE) phase. This paper presents the results of a Systematic Literature Mapping whose goal is to understand the current state of approaches concerning privacy and security in RE domain. We divided the results into research topics, research methods, types of study, research problems and indications of future works regarding the field of privacy and security in RE.
